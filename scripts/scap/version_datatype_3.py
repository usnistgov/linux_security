    :cvar STRING: The string datatype describes standard string data.
        This datatype conforms to the W3C Recommendation for string
        data.  Expected operations within OVAL for string values are
        'equals', 'not equal', 'case insensitive equals', 'case
        insensitive not equal', 'pattern match'.
    :cvar VERSION: The version datatype represents a value that is a
        hierarchical list of non-negative integers separated by a single
        character delimiter.  Note that any non-number character can be
        used as a delimiter and that different characters can be used
        within the same version string.  So '#.#-#' is the same as
        '#.#.#' or '#c#c#' where '#' is any non-negative integer.
        Expected operations within OVAL for version values are 'equals',
        'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or equal', 'less
        than', and 'less than or equal'. For example '#.#.#' or
        '#-#-#-#' where the numbers to the left are more significant
        than the numbers to the right. When performing an 'equals'
        operation on a version datatype, you should first check the left
        most number for equality. If that fails, then the values are not
        equal. If it succeeds, then check the second left most number
        for equality. Continue checking the numbers from left to right
        until the last number has been checked. If, after testing all
        the previous numbers, the last number is equal then the two
        versions are equal. When performing other operations, such as
        'less than', 'less than or equal', 'greater than, or 'greater
        than or equal', similar logic as above is used. Start with the
        left most number and move from left to right. For each number,
        check if it is less than the number you are testing against. If
        it is, then the version in question is less than the version you
        are testing against. If the number is equal, then move to check
        the next number to the right. For example, to test if 5.7.23 is
        less than or equal to 5.8.0 you first compare 5 to 5. They are
        equal so you move on to compare 7 to 8. 7 is less than 8 so the
        entire test succeeds and 5.7.23 is 'less than or equal' to
        5.8.0. The difference between the 'less than' and 'less than or
        equal' operations is how the last number is handled. If the last
        number is reached, the check should use the given operation
        (either 'less than' and 'less than or equal') to test the
        number. For example, to test if 4.23.6 is greater than 4.23.6
        you first compare 4 to 4. They are equal so you move on to
        compare 23 to 23. They are equal so you move on to compare 6 to
        6. This is the last number in the version and since 6 is not
        greater than 6, the entire test fails and 4.23.6 is not greater
        than 4.23.6. Version strings with a different number of
        components shall be padded with zeros to make them the same
        size. For example, if the version strings '1.2.3' and '6.7.8.9'
        are being compared, then the short one should be padded to
        become '1.2.3.0'.
