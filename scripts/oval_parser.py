# The OVAL spec, at least defined in oscap, is over 20 c and h files, which is a huge implementation load for a single developer
# There is not a good (or any?) OVAL parsing library for Python
# This code will not purport to be a fully compliant OVAL parsing engine, but that can be a future goal
# For now, focus will be on achieving a complete implementation of all features present in RHEL 8-10 and Ubuntu 20-24's datastreams
