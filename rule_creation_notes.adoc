Mapping SSG rules to SCPLinux Rules

SSG files can be found in resources folder.  These are easiest to read if opened in a browser.

Use rules/os/os_aide_installed.yaml as an example.

Determine what "type" of rule this is (audit, auth, networking, os, pwpolicy, serivices, or ssh)
The above type list is not exhaustive but is our starting point.  We can discuss creating additional types.

File names are <type>_<descriptive noun>_<verb>.yaml
    For our example above
        type = "os"
        descriptive noun = "aide"
        verb = "installed"
    Descriptive Nouns can me multiple words like in the rule "os_fips_mode_enabled.yaml".  The descriptive
    noun is "fips_mode"

Rules are located in their "type" directory.  Thus all of the "os" rules are in the rules/os directory.

In the rule the following should be filled out as follows
    id: is the file name minus the .yaml (i.e os_aide_installed)
    title: is a reasonable title for this rule, direct and too the point.
    discussion: use the SSG "Rationale" section or something descriptive like it.  This should answer the
        question "Why do this?" if possible, more verbose than the title.
    check: leave as in the example
    results: leave as in the example
    fix: leave as in the example
    references: this has several subcategories that should be included
        cce: leave as in the example
        cci: pull from the SSG "Identifiers and References" section, will start with CCI
        800_53r5: pull from the SSG "Identifiers and References" section
        srg: pull from the SSG "Identifiers and References" section, will start with SRG
        disa_stig: leave as in the example
    tags: leave as in the example, we will be revisiting these
    severity: pull from the SSG "Severity" section
    os_specifics: this can be filled in if you want but for now can be left empty but I will not complain
        if you take a stab at it. <smiley>
