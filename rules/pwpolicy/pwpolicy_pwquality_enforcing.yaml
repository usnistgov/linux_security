title: "Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Enforcing"
discussion: |
  Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Using enforcing=1 ensures "pwquality" enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the system.
