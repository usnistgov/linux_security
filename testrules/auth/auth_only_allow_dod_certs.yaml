title: Only Allow DoD PKI-established CAs
discussion: |
  Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they
  may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise
  DoD systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls. If
  the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA,
  trust of this CA has not been established.
  The DoD will only accept PKI-certificates obtained from a DoD-approved
  internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the
  establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of
  SSL/TLS certificates.
