title: Install the opensc Package For Multifactor Authentication
discussion: |
  Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate from
  the information system, ensures that even if the information system is
  compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
  authentication device.


  Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from
  information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens
  providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such
  as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common
  Access Card.
