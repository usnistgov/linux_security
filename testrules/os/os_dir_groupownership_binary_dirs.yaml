title: Verify that system commands directories are group owned by root
discussion: |
  If the operating system allows any user to make changes to software
  libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the
  appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management
  process.
  This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries
  that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.
  Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with
  escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be
  allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes
  of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.
