title: Policy Requires Immediate Change of Temporary Passwords
discussion: |
  Without providing this capability, an account may be created without a
  password. Nonrepudiation cannot be guaranteed once an account is created if
  a user is not forced to change the temporary password upon initial logon.

  Temporary passwords are typically used to allow access when new accounts
  are created or passwords are changed. It is common practice for
  administrators to create temporary passwords for user accounts that allow
  the users to log on, yet force them to change the password once they have
  successfully authenticated.
