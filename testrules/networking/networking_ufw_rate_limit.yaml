title: ufw Must rate-limit network interfaces
discussion: |
  This requirement addresses the configuration of the operating system to
  mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on
  system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks
  must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety
  of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects
  of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory
  partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with
  service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.
