title: Only Allow Authorized Network Services in ufw
discussion: |
  To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of
  information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types
  within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or
  unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

  Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
  and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default
  may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.
  Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services
  from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so
  increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.

  To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the
  operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing
  only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols,
  and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to
  conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life
  issues.
