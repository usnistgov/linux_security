title: Uninstall rsh-server Package
discussion: |
  The rsh-server service provides unencrypted remote access service which does not
  provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session and has very weak
  authentication. If a privileged user were to login using this service, the privileged user password
  could be compromised. The rsh-server package provides several obsolete and insecure
  network services. Removing it decreases the risk of those services' accidental (or intentional)
  activation.
