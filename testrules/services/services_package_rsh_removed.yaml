title: Uninstall rsh Package
discussion: |
  These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have
  been replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed,
  it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from
  inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore exposing

  their credentials. Note that removing the rsh package removes

  the clients for rsh,rcp, and rlogin.
